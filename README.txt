You'll need Python 3.4+ and must install these packages:
PyOpenGL, GLFW

To run different version you will have to comment out two out of the three questions
Each question shows a different algorithm for completing the task

example (This will run question 4 code):

#Question 2
#....
#....
#....
#....

#Question 3
#....
#....
#....
#....

#Question 4
....
....
....
....

Question 2 uses a Greedy Algorithm
Question 3 uses a Greedy Algorithm but also implements a sorting function
Question 4 uses the most efficient algorithm that involves recursion

Comment out the highlighted portion of code you want to run using Ctrl + K + C
To Uncomment a highlighted portion of code use Ctrl + K + U

By default my code is using the most efficient algorithm
