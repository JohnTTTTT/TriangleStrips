To run my code you will have to comment out two out of the three questions

example (This will run question 4 code):

#Question 2
#....
#....
#....
#....

#Question 3
#....
#....
#....
#....

#Question 4
....
....
....
....

Comment out the highlighted portion of code you want to run using Ctrl + K + C
To Uncomment a highlighted portion of code use Ctrl + K + U

Also I was unsure what question 5 meant when they said to remove all the display() calls
To run my code I used the drawArrow function and I'm going to leave it in but just delete that portion if it interferes with you testing my code
