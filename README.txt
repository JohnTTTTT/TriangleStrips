You'll need Python 3.4+ and must install these packages:
PyOpenGL, GLFW

main2.py uses a Greedy Algorithm
main3.py uses a Greedy Algorithm but also implements a sorting function
main4.py uses the most efficient algorithm that involves recursion

To run the code use the command line:

  python3 main2.py 200
  
This will execute the least effective algorithm with the file containing 200 points

Another example:
  
  python3 main4.py 10000
  
 This will execute the most effective algorithm with the file containing 10000 points
